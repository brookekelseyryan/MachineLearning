## Statement of Academic Integrity
This repository contains my homework and notes for the quarter.  

Intellectual development requires honesty, responsibility, and doing your own work. Taking ideas or words from others -- plagiarising -- is dishonest and will result in possibly other disciplinary actions.  If you are unsure about what consitutes plagiarism, consult UCI's Academic Integrity Policy, which can be found here: https://aisc.uci.edu/students/academic-integrity/index.php

Feel free to use this repository as a reference (e.g., for correctness verification or as an inspiration), but please do not submit copies the code provided here as homework solutions--you won't learn anything from doing so, and you will most likely get caught.
